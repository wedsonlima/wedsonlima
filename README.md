### About Work

I work with web development since **2009** and more specifically with **Ruby on Rails** since **2011** and with **PostgresSQL** since **2008**.

### About Books

I like books about science fiction (**Asimov**, Frank Herbert and, more recently, **John Scalzi** and Martha Wells), fantasy (**Tolkien** is the best), finance, technology, biographies and many others.

Best books I've read (not in order):

  * The Lord Of The Rings (Tolkien) - of course
  * Foundation (Asimov)
  * Dune (Frank Herbert)
  * Old Man's War (Scalzi)
  * The Mysterious Island (Jules Verne)
  * Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Harari)

### About Music

I like to work listening to mostly Metallica, Black Sabbath, Raul Seixas and, more recently, Gojira and Sepultura.

### About Personal Projects

I have a new idea for a big project every week day.
Many of these projects end up lost for some years, others I'm ashamed about but some are worth to work on.

Oh, I have a small bakery with my brother. It's kinda cool.
